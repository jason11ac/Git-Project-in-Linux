This gitk is showing a visual view of the git repository set up for emacs
that was worked on by Eggert himself. 

There are five windows total in the view. The top left shows all the changes
and merges with a visual line and dot diagram. A left most line is the master 
line and when a merge master happens the dot for that certain line moves to
the master line. The diagram basically shows all the heads, branches and 
commits that were made.

The bottom left window contains the SHAI ID and info about the selected commit, 
merge or change. This info includes the name of the change, author, committer, 
parents, children, branches, follows and precedes.

The bottom right window can show comments, patched files, a tree of files
and more information if needed.

The top right most window has the dates for all the changes in the top left.

Finally, the top middle window has the author of the commit and their email info
from git.
