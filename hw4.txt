First step, was to checkout into a new branch called "quote". 
I typed:

	git checkout v3.0 -b quote

to do this. Because the file quote-3.0-patch.txt was not on this
new branch I then used the command below to transfer the file 
from my Backticks v3.0 branch:

	git checkout Backticks quote-3.0-patch.txt

Once the file was transferred, I typed the patching command:

	patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt 

and the ouput simply read:

	patching file src/cmp.c
	patching file src/diff.c
	patching file src/diff3.c
	patching file src/dir.c
	patching file src/sdiff.c
	patching file src/util.c

showing that the patch did it's job. 

Next I opened diff.c in my src directory and used Ctrl-x 4 a
to bring up a changelog. I then said what changes I made to all
6 files, which were the same for each one:

 	January 27th 2016 - Jason Alvarez-Cohen

    Changed all non-comment backticks (`) to single quotes (')

I then saved and my file Changelog now held all the documented 
changed I just made. 

The next step was to commit all the changes and new files, so I 
first put all the modified and untracked files on the staging
area by using the command:

	git add .

before I commited all the changes with my ChangeLog file as the 
commit message:

	git commit -F ChangeLog

Next, I used the git format-patch command to get my patch ready for
others to use over servers. I used the command below for this:

	git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

which created a formatted-patch text file from the standard output
of what was different against stage 1. 

At this point my partner Zach Thomas was not at the point I was at 
in the homework so I instead decided to create a new branch and test
the git am command myself. I typed:

	git checkout v3.0 -b tester
	git am < formatted-patch.txt

I then built the system using bootstrap, configure and make like before
and the patch was implemented correctly. Once Zach was ready we both 
confirmed that our patches worked using git am. After confirming the patch
worked using am, I next made sure my ChangeLog worked with the commands:

	make distdir
	cd diffutils*

This created the directory diffutils-3.0.1-094e. I checked the ChangeLog 
in this directory and saw the message I wrote for creating my formatted
patch file confirming that my ChangeLog was updated correctly.

My next task was to implement and run gitk. I couldn't get it to work
on my Mac terminal so I used a remote desktop connection to log onto the 
seasnet servers and run ssh from there. Gitk worked this way and I found 
the newest merge not after 2015-01-25 that was on this date:

	2015-01-24 17:11:31

I then took a screenshot of the picture and created a description, finishing
the homework for week 4.
